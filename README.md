# Advent of code 2024

**hi**

I've finally sent this to github :)

should probably do this with all my other projects as well



those are my solutions for advent of code 2024

written in rust as a part of  2024 rust advent of code challenge (or sth like that - I will check later)

tho I am considering to revisit some puzzles in python and solving them in most convoluted and cursed way possible :P

usually the main.rs contains my first solution to a that day's puzzle and other bin files might have better, cleaner or more fun solution

oryginal solution is usually  unchanged, so this means it can be scuffed or unreadible

all files solve both parts of the puzzle and I usually try to have them as connected to each other as possible
